1521296855803609094,@SpectreJordan Nope not as good as lost legacy. It’s not my favorite uncharted either by any stretch.

1521296716175220736,@serdavos731 Yep I love p4g. I just don’t like the characters as much and the phantom thieves premise. I thought the story handled trauma poorly and I can’t deal with it. P5 not a bad game for sure! I wish I loved it but I just have to accept persona 4 for me as the peak for now,Gene Park,GenePark,2022-05-03T01:12:56.000Z,Tue May 03 01:12:56 +0000 2022,2,0,en,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",Reply,,0,1,,,,,

1521292831826104330,@LovelyDegree160 For sure. I dunno if I like the enemy types in miles as much either but that’s just a small nitpick. I go back and forth.
